# DeepSVDD (One-Class Classification) for Network Anomaly Detection
This is the GitHub Repository of the thesis "Analysis of the deep one-class classification procedure applied on network anomaly detection tasks"

The "Data Analysis" Jupyter Notebook provides some profound data analysis files with one data set. (UNSW-NB15)

The "UNSWNB15_Dataset-OneClass" Jupyter Notebook provides the deep one-class classification with the UNSW-NB15 dataset.
On the other hand the "Kddcup99_Dataset-OneClass" notebook provides the same for the Kddcup99 dataset.
